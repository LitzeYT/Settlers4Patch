# FAQ
## Installation

#### What happens to my settings during installation? 
The settings are not changed unless stated otherwise.

### What do I need?
For this modification an original Uplay "The Settlers IV History Edition" version is required. There is no NOCD.exe included!  

### Do I still need Uplay?
Uplay is still needed! The app still starts the game via Uplay. 

### My virus scanner is alerting!
If there are problems starting the app, please add an exception to your virus scanner for the program. The scanner is i.a. working because we do not have official certificates.

### Is Windows 7 supported?
Windows 7 is no longer fully supported by Ubisoft. It might work, but it doesn't have to.

### Net.FrameWork Missing?
[Net.FrameWork 4.6.2 Download](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/download/details.aspx?id=53344)

### Back to the History Edition
Once a backup has been created, you only need to switch to the History Edition in the lower left corner. The backup will then be restored.

### Problems starting?
If in doubt, please uninstall both Launcher and Settlers IV. Delete the Uplay Games folder of TheSettlers4.
Afterwards reinstall "The Settlers IV History Edition". 

#### What happens to my settings during the reinstallation? 
If necessary save the files "GameSettings.cfg", "MiscData1.cfg" and "MiscData2.cfg" in the Config folder.

#### What happens to my savegames when I reinstall? 
They are located under "Documents\TheSettlers4\Save" and are not changed. But backups are always useful!
